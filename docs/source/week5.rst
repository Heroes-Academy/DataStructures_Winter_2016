Week 5: Stacks and Queues
=========================


Summary
-------

We discussed linked lists, stacks, and queues.
We implemented a Linked List class using paired programming.

We also discussed how a linked list could be extended as a queue and stack.
Specifically, that a stack is a last-in-first-out implementation and queue is a first-in-first-out implementation.

Homework
--------

I expect you to complete all of the following by next Sunday.

1. Finish your recursive turtle implementation
2. Finish the recursive solutions homework problems (the last slide of the week 3 slides)
3. Make the LinkedList doubly linked.
4. Implement a Stack and a Queue using the LinkedList as a template and base.
