Week 1: Initialization
======================

Summary
^^^^^^^

This week we introduced the concepts of search and complexity.  The overall idea is that tasks like search require data structures to be efficient.  They also require the rights strategy.  We looked at this with both the peanut butter sandwich exercise and the sorting cards exercise.  After this, the class created accounts on hackerrank.com. The site provides a variety of programming puzzles that cover a wide range of topics.  We focused on the easier Python topics to refresh Python knowledge and sharpen programming skills.


Homework
^^^^^^^^

Try to get to at least rank 5000 on hackerrank.com in the Python section.
