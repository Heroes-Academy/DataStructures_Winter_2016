Week 4: Linked Lists
====================


Summary
^^^^^^^

Because of the snow storm last week, this week we went over recursion and the basics of linked lists.

Homework
^^^^^^^^

You should work through your own recursive turtles.  You should also solve the recursion problems in the slides.  Those slides are on the week 3 page.  It is recommended that you also work through the LinkedList class and get a basic working example.
