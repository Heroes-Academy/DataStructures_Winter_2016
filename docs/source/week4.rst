Week 4: Linked Lists
====================


Summary
-------

Because of the snow storm last week, this week we went over recursion and the basics of linked lists.

Homework
--------

1. You should work through your own recursive turtles.
2. You should also solve the recursion problems in the slides.
    - Those slides are on the week 3 page.

Optional but Recommended:
- It is recommended that you also work through the LinkedList class and get a basic working example.

For a challenge:
- try to do the exercises found on the `Think CS python book <http://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/recursion.html#exercises>`_
